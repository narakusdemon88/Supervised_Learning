# Assignment 1 - Supervised Learning


## About this project:
This repository contains code implementations for five machine learning algorithms:
1. Decision Tree
2. K Nearest Neighbors
3. Neural Network
4. Support Vector Machine
5. Adaboost

The algorithms have been applied to two datasets:
1. Titanic dataset (titanic.csv)
2. Wine Quality dataset (wine-quality.csv)

Both datasets are avaiable within this repository, however they can be found on Kaggle.com or many other websites in various forms.

## Requirements:
The code has been tested and developed using Python 3.8 and uses the following packages:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. scikit-learn
4. tensorflow

## Usage:
To run all experiments, please follow the steps below:
1. Clone the repository
   ```console
    foo@bar:~$ git clone https://git...
    ```
2. Install the necessary packages using the requirements.txt document
    ```console
    foo@bar:~$ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the experiments using run_experiments.py or running an individual part
    ```console
    foo@bar:~$ python run_experiments.py
    ```
   
## Results:
Graphical images will be outputted in the images directory.
